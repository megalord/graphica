# Graphica - Interactive Image Processing

### What is Graphica?

Graphica is an image processing tool using the HTML5 canvas.  Unlike common image processors such as photoshop or gimp, Graphica is more low-level, scientific application with a focus on education and process prototyping.

### Why use Graphica?

Graphica serves as an alternative to image processing using MATLAB.  Although MATLAB is more powerful, Graphica has advantages in testing speed and accessibility.  Rather than having to constantly edit m files and compare results after re-running the program, Graphica allows the user to quickly execute multiple processes on the same image with a few clicks.  As a web application, it is available on any desktop computer without installation.  Further, work can be saved into JSON files and resumed on another machine and/or a later date.  Once the desired process has been prototyped, the user must simply copy the used function parameters into their automation of choice.

### Other information

The application's processes are all implemented for black and white images.  Uploaded color images should be first converted to black and white, which is an option in the menu.

The page includes a concise help guide, however, the methods are not accompanied by an explanation since this is intended for users who are familiar to image processing (again, scientific prototyping - not a photoshop clone).
